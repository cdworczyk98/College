<h2>Implementation</h2>

<a name="Implement"></a><p>It is a major milestone when we reach this stage of the lifecycle!  All of our hard work has resulted in a working computer system.  We will have tested the system as best as we could during logical and physical design, but until the system is implemented we cannot be sure of its behaviour.  Testing is an important part of the development process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at some point we need to implement the system.  So how do we go about this?  There are several options available to us. Let us look at these options individually:</p>
<p><b>Direct Implementation</b></p>
<p>Using this technique, we simply 'switch off' the old system and 'switch on' the new system.  You can imagine that this could be quite risky if we were less than 100% sure that the system was going to work properly.  But it has the advantage of being simple to implement.</p>
<p><b>Parallel Running</b></p>
<p>Rather than 'switching off' the old system, we keep it running alongside the new one, comparing the output from both.  If the two systems are producing the same results with no side effects over a period of time, we can be sure that the new system is working, and, at some suitable time, the old system can finally be discontinued.</p>
<p>An advantage of this scheme is that it is safe, but the disadvantages might be that it is not possible to do at all or that it is too expensive to implement.</p>
<p><b>Staged Implementation</b></p>
<p>As each stage of the new system is designed and tested, it is then implemented.  This has the advantage of implementing the system gradually, therefore allowing ongoing user training and the added security of the old system being available if required. Finally, the complete system is implemented.</p>
<p><b>Pilot Running</b></p>
<p>This would be appropriate where the company runs the system in several different sites and wishes to implement the system quickly.  In this case the system could be implemented on one site only and testing/observation of it could take place in isolation from the rest of the organisation.  If anything were to go wrong, damage would be limited to one area only. </p>
